# Synthetic-Data-Driven-Image-Classification-using-Diffusion-Models-and-YOLOv8
Uses Gemini and Stable Diffusion to generate synthetic image data for training a YOLOv8 classification model. Addresses data scarcity by creating a custom dataset, demonstrating a pipeline for generating and using AI-generated data for computer vision tasks.
